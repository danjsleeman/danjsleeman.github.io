02 – We should all teach

Camped up in a country cottage over four days of tech-free bliss around the chaos of Christmas and New Year, I managed to dive into a couple of books that have been on my to-read list for a while.
One of these titles was Skin in the Game (2017) by Nassim Nicholas Taleb.  

I have been a fan of Taleb since I first read Fooled by Randomness (2001). While he comes off as a little (or a lot) in-your-face and cantankerous, I really appreciate his provocative style – and I think his writing is just bloody funny.

While Taleb can’t claim the term 'skin the game' – thanks Warren Buffet – his primary idea is this: To expose oneself to the downsides as well as the upsides of a particular decision or action is to have skin in the game.

Taleb harks back to the Code of Hammurabi (some of humanities earliest legal writings) to illustrate his point. One of these Babylonian laws states: “If a builder builds a house and the house collapses and causes the death of the owner of the house – the builder shall be put to death.”

In other words: If you take a cut of the rewards, you must also take on some of the risks and not let others pay the price of your mistakes.

Of course, it is possible to skew the game in a way that allows for win-win scenarios, removing individual downside altogether.

Taleb calls this a Bob Rubin trade, named after the eponymous banker who benefited greatly through financial market environments in the lead up to the 2008 financial crisis. When the market eventually collapsed, Rubin – working for Citigroup – wasn’t held accountable for his actions. “[Rubin] collected more than $120 million in compensation from Citibank in the decade preceding the banking crash of 2008,” writes Taleb. “When the bank, literally insolvent, was rescued by the taxpayer, he didn't write any check – he invoked uncertainty as an excuse."

That is to say Bob Rubin skewed the rules of game in his favour: “Heads, I win. Tails, you lose.” Or more likely - “if we succeed, I contributed; If we fail, I had nothing to do with this”.

This mental model has an astounding number of applications within higher education, which by it’s nature is built on varied and complex incentive structures and systems.

I want to pull out one particular application which comes to mind.

The gap between strategy and the classroom

One characteristic of the modern university is its increasingly professionalised operating model.
The more ‘professional’ the university workforce becomes, the further decision makers – usually administrative and professional staff – are from the educational activities of the university.
